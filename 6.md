Let's continue with **Unit-6: Pattern Recognition in Medical Imaging**. This unit explores how pattern recognition techniques are applied within the healthcare domain to analyze medical images for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring.

# Unit-6: Pattern Recognition in Medical Imaging [5 Hrs.]

## 6.1 Medical Imaging Modalities

Medical imaging plays a critical role in healthcare by enabling non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures and physiological processes. Pattern recognition techniques are increasingly used to automatically analyze medical images for tasks such as segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection. Medical imaging modalities vary widely based on the physical principles they exploit, the anatomical details they reveal, and their clinical applications.

### 2. Medical Imaging Modalities (Detailed)

1.  **X-ray Radiography (X-ray)**:
    *   **Principle**: Projects a 2D image by passing X-rays through the body. Denser tissues (like bone) absorb more X-rays than less dense tissues (like soft tissue or air), creating a shadow image on a detector.
    *   **What it shows**: Internal body structures, primarily bones.
    *   **Best Suited For**: Imaging bones, detecting fractures, identifying some lung conditions (e.g., pneumonia), and foreign objects.
    *   **Limitations**:
        *   **Poor contrast for soft tissues**: Difficult to differentiate between various soft tissues (muscles, organs) as they have similar X-ray absorption properties.
        *   **Ionizing radiation**: Involves exposure to radiation, which carries a small health risk with repeated exposure.
        *   **2D projection**: Overlapping structures can obscure details.

2.  **Computed Tomography (CT)**:
    *   **Principle**: Uses multiple X-ray beams rotated around the patient to acquire a series of 2D cross-sectional images (slices). Computer processing then reconstructs these slices into detailed 3D volumetric images.
    *   **What it shows**: Cross-sectional 3D images of internal structures.
    *   **Best Suited For**:
        *   **Excellent spatial resolution**: Provides sharp, detailed images, particularly for bone, soft tissue, and blood vessels. Useful for lung imaging, bone lesions, and cancer detection.
        *   Detecting subtle differences in tissue density.
    *   **Limitations**:
        *   **Significant radiation dose**: Higher radiation exposure than a single X-ray, making it less suitable for frequent follow-up scans.
        *   Can be affected by metallic artifacts.

3.  **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**:
    *   **Principle**: Utilizes strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to align and then perturb the body's hydrogen atoms (primarily water). When the radiofrequency pulse is turned off, the hydrogen atoms release energy, which is detected and used to create detailed images.
    *   **What it shows**: Highly detailed images of soft tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, muscles, ligaments, and internal organs.
    *   **Best Suited For**:
        *   **Superior soft tissue contrast**: Ideal for visualizing brain tumors, spinal cord abnormalities, heart conditions, and joint injuries.
        *   **No ionizing radiation**: Does not involve radiation exposure, making it safer for repeated scans and for pediatric or pregnant patients.
    *   **Limitations**:
        *   **Long scan times**: Can be lengthy, requiring patients to remain still for extended periods.
        *   **High cost**: Generally more expensive than X-rays or CT.
        *   Cannot be used with certain metallic implants (e.g., pacemakers, some joint replacements).
        *   Sensitive to patient movement.

4.  **Ultrasound Imaging (US)**:
    *   **Principle**: Employs high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound waves) emitted by a transducer. These waves reflect off internal body structures, and the transducer detects the echoes. The time it takes for echoes to return and their intensity are used to create real-time images.
    *   **What it shows**: Real-time images of soft tissues, blood flow, and organ motion.
    *   **Best Suited For**:
        *   **Real-time imaging**: Excellent for visualizing dynamic processes like blood flow, heart contractions, and fetal movement. Widely used in obstetrics, cardiology, and abdominal imaging.
        *   **No ionizing radiation**: Safe for all patients, including pregnant women and children.
        *   Relatively inexpensive and portable.
    *   **Limitations**:
        *   **Operator-dependent**: Image quality and diagnostic accuracy heavily rely on the skill and experience of the sonographer.
        *   **Limited penetration**: Sound waves are attenuated by air and bone, making it difficult to image structures behind dense tissues or gas-filled organs.

5.  **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**:
    *   **Principle**: A **functional imaging modality** that uses **radiotracers** (radioactive substances, often combined with glucose) injected into the patient. The radiotracer accumulates in metabolically active cells. When the tracer decays, it emits positrons, which interact with electrons to produce gamma rays that are detected by the PET scanner.
    *   **What it shows**: Metabolic activity and function of tissues and organs, rather than just their anatomy. Areas with high metabolic activity (e.g., tumors, inflamed regions) show increased tracer uptake.
    *   **Applications**: Oncology (cancer detection, staging, and monitoring treatment response), neurology (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis), and cardiology (assessing heart function).
    *   **Often combined with CT (PET/CT) or MRI (PET/MRI)**: This fusion provides both functional information from PET and precise anatomical context from CT or MRI, aiding in accurate localization of metabolic activity.

## 6.2 Data Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Representation

Medical image data, regardless of the modality, needs to undergo systematic acquisition, preprocessing, and structured representation to be effectively utilized for pattern recognition and clinical analysis.

### Data Acquisition

*   **Process**: Medical image acquisition involves capturing physical signals (e.g., X-rays, sound waves, magnetic resonance signals) and converting them into digital images that computers can process.
*   **Dimensionality**: Data may be acquired in:
    *   **2D**: Single-slice images (e.g., X-ray radiography, traditional ultrasound images, individual slices from CT/MRI scans). Represented as pixel grids.
    *   **3D**: Volumetric data (e.g., full CT scans, MRI sequences, PET scans). These are stacks of 2D slices, where each "pixel" becomes a **voxel** (volume element) representing a discrete point in a 3D space.
*   **Common Artifacts**: Raw acquired data often contains imperfections that can hinder analysis. These include:
    *   **Noise**: Random variations in signal intensity or color (e.g., electronic noise from the scanner, physiological noise from patient breathing/heartbeat).
    *   **Motion blur**: Caused by patient movement during the scan, leading to blurred or distorted images.
    *   **Aliasing**: Artifacts caused by undersampling the signal, leading to misrepresentation of high-frequency information.
    *   **Metal artifacts**: Streaks or distortions caused by metallic implants (e.g., dental fillings, surgical clips) in CT scans.
    *   **Magnetic field inhomogeneity**: Distortions in MRI scans due to variations in the magnetic field.

### 3.2 Preprocessing

Preprocessing is essential for refining raw medical image data to enhance its quality, reduce artifacts, and improve the accuracy of subsequent analysis tasks.

#### 3.2.1 Noise Reduction

Medical images often contain noise—random variations in brightness or color that don’t represent real anatomical structures. This noise can originate from:
*   **Machine limitations**: inherent electronic noise in sensors.
*   **Patient movement**: involuntary movements during long scans.
*   **External interference factors**: electromagnetic interference.

**Common Noise Reduction Methods:**
*   **Gaussian Filtering**:
    *   **Applies**: A soft blur using a "bell-curve" distribution.
    *   **Mechanism**: Smooths the image by averaging neighboring pixels, with weights decreasing with distance from the center.
    *   **Example**: Reduces grainy appearance in X-ray scans.
*   **Median Filtering**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbors.
    *   **Effective against**: "Salt-and-pepper" noise (random bright or dark pixels).
    *   **Example**: Cleans speckle artifacts in ultrasound images while preserving edges better than mean filters.
*   **Wavelet Denoising**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Decomposes the image into frequency components across different scales. Noisy frequencies (usually high-frequency components) are selectively removed or suppressed.
    *   **Reconstructs**: A cleaner image.
    *   **Example**: Enhances details in brain MRI while preserving textures, by removing noise without blurring important features.

#### Other Preprocessing Techniques:

*   **Normalization**:
    *   **Purpose**: Adjusting image intensities for consistency. This can involve scaling pixel values to a fixed range (e.g., 0-255 or 0-1) or standardizing them to have a zero mean and unit variance across different images or scans.
    *   **Importance**: Ensures that intensity variations due to acquisition parameters or different scanners do not negatively impact analysis.

*   **Image Registration**:
    *   **Purpose**: Aligning multiple images from different modalities (e.g., fusing PET and CT scans) or different time points (e.g., tracking tumor growth over time in follow-up MRI scans).
    *   **Types**:
        *   **Rigid registration**: Involves only translation and rotation.
        *   **Non-rigid (deformable) registration**: Accounts for non-linear deformations (e.g., organ motion, anatomical changes).

*   **Artifact Correction**:
    *   **Purpose**: Specific algorithms designed to remove artifacts unique to certain modalities.
    *   **Examples**:
        *   Removal of metal artifacts in CT scans (e.g., using iterative reconstruction algorithms).
        *   Magnetic field inhomogeneity correction in MRI (e.g., using bias field correction).

### 3.3 Data Representation (Post-Preprocessing)

After acquisition and preprocessing, medical images are structured into formats suitable for analysis.

*   **2D Images**:
    *   **Representation**: Represented as pixel grids (Height x Width) with one or more channels (e.g., grayscale, RGB).
    *   **Applicable for**: X-rays, ultrasound, and individual slices of CT/MRI scans.

*   **3D Volumes**:
    *   **Representation**: Stacks of 2D slices forming volumetric data. Each volumetric element is called a **voxel** (volume pixel), carrying intensity information in 3D space.
    *   **Applicable for**: Full CT, MRI, and PET scans. This representation allows for volumetric analysis and visualization.

*   **Multi-modal Data**:
    *   **Representation**: Integration of images from multiple modalities (e.g., PET/CT, PET/MRI) into a combined dataset.
    *   **Importance**: Enhances diagnostic power by providing complementary information (e.g., anatomical detail from CT/MRI with functional information from PET).

## 6.3 Medical Image Segmentation

**Medical image segmentation** is a crucial step in the analysis of medical images. It involves dividing an image into distinct regions or objects that correspond to different anatomical structures (e.g., organs, tissues) or pathological areas (e.g., tumors, lesions). Accurate segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring.

### 4.1 Purpose of Segmentation

Segmentation provides clear boundaries and quantitative insights:
*   **Clear Definition of Structures or Abnormal Areas**:
    *   Helps to clearly define the boundaries of organs (e.g., liver, heart, brain) or abnormal regions (e.g., tumors, cysts).
    *   This boundary definition is essential for radiologists and surgeons to accurately interpret medical images.
*   **Quantification**:
    *   Once regions are segmented, quantitative analysis becomes possible. Clinicians can measure the size, volume, shape, and even density of structures.
    *   This is vital for monitoring disease progression or treatment response (e.g., tracking tumor volume over time in cancer patients to assess treatment effectiveness).
*   **Visualization**:
    *   Segmented images allow for enhanced visualization, often with color coding or 3D rendering. This makes it easier to understand complex anatomical relationships.
    *   For instance, in neurosurgery planning, segmented brain tissues help in avoiding critical regions during surgery.
*   **Treatment Planning and Diagnosis**:
    *   In **radiation therapy**, accurate segmentation ensures that radiation is precisely targeted to tumors while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.
    *   Automated segmentation supports **computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)** systems by identifying abnormalities and providing input for further analysis.

### 4.2 Segmentation Techniques

Various techniques are used for medical image segmentation, ranging from traditional methods to advanced machine learning approaches.

#### 4.2.1 Thresholding

*   **Principle**: The simplest form of segmentation that classifies pixels based on their intensity values.
*   **Mechanism**: A global or local intensity threshold is set. If a pixel's intensity is above or below this threshold, it is assigned to a specific class (e.g., object or background).
*   **Example**: In a CT scan, bones appear very bright (high density), while soft tissues are darker. A simple threshold can effectively separate bones from soft tissues.
*   **Limitation**: Works best only when there is a clear, distinct intensity contrast between the regions of interest and the background/other tissues. Fails when intensities overlap or in noisy images.

#### 4.2.2 Region-based Methods

These methods group together neighboring pixels with similar properties (like intensity, color, or texture).

*   **Region Growing**:
    *   **Principle**: Starts from one or more "seed" pixels (chosen by a user or automatically). Neighboring pixels that are similar in intensity or other properties to the seed are added to the region. The process expands iteratively until no more similar neighbors can be found.
    *   **Example**: Segmenting a liver in an abdominal CT scan by growing the region from a central point within the liver.
*   **Watershed Segmentation**:
    *   **Principle**: Treats the image like a topographic map, where pixel intensities represent "elevations." It then simulates water filling from "minima" (dark regions) and builds "dams" (boundaries) where water from different basins meets.
    *   **Example**: Separating overlapping cells in microscopic images.
    *   **Advantage**: Can produce accurate boundaries even for complex shapes.

#### 4.2.3 Edge-based Methods

These techniques detect boundaries where there is a sudden change in intensity.

*   **Common Edge Detectors**:
    *   **Sobel, Prewitt, Canny**: These filters (as discussed in Unit 2) detect sudden changes in image intensity, which correspond to edges.
    *   **Mechanism**: Identify the outline of structures based on intensity gradients.
*   **Example**: Identifying the outline of a tumor in an MRI scan.
*   **Limitations**:
    *   **Very sensitive to noise**: Noise can produce spurious edges.
    *   **Edges may be broken or too weak**: In low-contrast images, edges might not be fully connected or strong enough for accurate segmentation.

#### 4.2.4 Model-based Methods

These methods use mathematical models to evolve curves or surfaces that outline structures, often driven by image forces and internal smoothness constraints.

*   **Active Contours (Snakes)**:
    *   **Principle**: These are deformable curves that "snap" onto object boundaries. They move under the influence of:
        *   **Internal forces**: Promote smoothness and continuity of the curve.
        *   **External forces**: Attract the curve towards image features like edges (image gradients).
    *   **Example**: Accurately segmenting organs with complex shapes, like the brain or heart.
*   **Level Sets**:
    *   **Principle**: Implicitly represents contours as the zero-level set of a higher-dimensional function. The evolution of the contour is governed by a partial differential equation.
    *   **Advantage**: Capable of handling topological changes automatically (e.g., merging or splitting regions), making them robust for complex shapes.

#### 4.2.5 Machine Learning-based Methods

Modern approaches use data-driven models to learn segmentation patterns from annotated examples, offering superior performance in complex scenarios.

*   **Classical Machine Learning**:
    *   **Algorithms**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.
    *   **Mechanism**: Use hand-crafted features extracted from images (e.g., texture, intensity, shape descriptors) to train classifiers that predict pixel labels.
*   **Deep Learning**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Uses neural networks (especially Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) to learn hierarchical features directly from raw images, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
    *   **U-Net and V-Net**: Specialized deep learning architectures designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation.
        *   **U-Net**: Characterized by its U-shaped architecture, which combines an encoder (downsampling path to capture context) and a decoder (upsampling path to enable precise localization). It uses **skip connections** between corresponding encoder and decoder layers to preserve fine-grained details lost during downsampling.
        *   **V-Net**: A 3D extension of U-Net, designed for volumetric medical image segmentation (e.g., CT, MRI scans).
        *   **Advantages**: These models capture both local (fine details) and global (contextual) image information, showing superior performance and achieving near human-level accuracy in many tasks.
*   **Example**: Automatic segmentation of tumors in MRI using U-Net, providing near human-level performance.

### 4.3 Challenges in Segmentation

Despite advancements, several challenges remain in medical image segmentation:

*   **Low Contrast**:
    *   **Problem**: In some medical images, the difference in intensity or appearance between different tissues or between healthy and pathological regions can be very subtle.
    *   **Impact**: Makes it hard for algorithms (and even human experts) to accurately delineate boundaries.
*   **Noise and Artifacts**:
    *   **Problem**: As discussed, images are susceptible to noise, motion blur, and other artifacts.
    *   **Impact**: These can distort edges or textures, leading to incorrect or imprecise segmentation results.
*   **Anatomical Variability**:
    *   **Problem**: Human anatomy varies significantly across individuals in terms of size, shape, and orientation. Pathological structures (like tumors) add even more variability.
    *   **Impact**: Models trained on one dataset may not generalize well to others, requiring large, diverse datasets or robust generalization techniques.
*   **Limited Labeled Data**:
    *   **Problem**: High-quality annotations (pixel-wise ground truth) for medical images require extensive manual effort by expert clinicians, making them time-consuming, expensive, and scarce.
    *   **Impact**: Limits the ability to train complex supervised deep learning models effectively.

## 6.4 3D Medical Image Analysis Techniques

Many modern medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET) naturally produce **volumetric (3D) data**. Analyzing these images in 3D is crucial because it captures the full spatial context and inter-relationships of anatomical structures, which might be missed by analyzing 2D slices independently.

### Motivation for 3D Analysis:

*   **Volumetric Data**: Modalities like CT, MRI, and PET inherently produce 3D images, where each "pixel" is a voxel.
*   **Captures Spatial Context and Relationships**: 3D analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of anatomical structures and pathologies in their true spatial arrangement, which is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. (e.g., understanding the full extent of a tumor).
*   **Avoids 2D Limitations**: Important information and relationships might be lost or misinterpreted if only individual 2D slices are analyzed.

### 5.2 Techniques for 3D Medical Image Analysis:

1.  **3D Visualization**:
    *   **Volume Rendering**: Visualizes internal structures by projecting 3D voxel data onto a 2D image plane. It assigns opacity and color values to voxels, allowing different tissues to be seen simultaneously (e.g., seeing a tumor within an organ).
    *   **Surface Rendering**: Extracts and displays 3D surfaces of specific anatomical structures (e.g., bones, organs) typically by defining an isosurface (a surface of constant intensity) within the volumetric data.
    *   **Multi-Planar Reformatting (MPR)**: Generates 2D views (axial, coronal, sagittal, or oblique) from 3D volumetric data. This allows clinicians to view the anatomy from any arbitrary angle.

2.  **3D Segmentation**:
    *   **Purpose**: To delineate anatomical structures or lesions in 3D volumetric data.
    *   **Techniques**:
        *   **3D U-Net and V-Net architectures**: Specialized deep learning models (as mentioned in 6.3) adapted for 3D inputs, enabling end-to-end volumetric segmentation.
        *   **Morphological operations**: 3D extensions of operations like dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, used to refine segmented volumes (e.g., removing small holes, smoothing boundaries).

3.  **3D Feature Extraction**:
    *   **Purpose**: Extracting quantitative descriptors from 3D medical images that can be used for classification, prediction, or diagnosis.
    *   **Shape Descriptors**: Quantify geometric properties of 3D objects. Examples include volume, surface area, sphericity, compactness, and Euler number.
    *   **Texture Features**: Characterize the local intensity patterns and variations within 3D regions. Examples include 3D Haralick features (contrast, energy, homogeneity) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) applied in 3D.
    *   **Radiomics**: A newer field that extracts a large number of high-dimensional quantitative features (including shape, texture, and intensity statistics) from medical images using advanced algorithms. These features are then used in predictive models for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.

4.  **Registration and Fusion**:
    *   **Registration**: Aligning multiple 3D volumes.
        *   **Rigid registration**: For aligning images with only translation and rotation (e.g., aligning two scans of the same patient taken at different times but without significant anatomical change).
        *   **Non-rigid (deformable) registration**: For aligning images with complex anatomical deformations (e.g., aligning pre-operative and intra-operative brain scans, or tracking organ motion).
    *   **Multi-modal fusion**: Combining information from different 3D imaging modalities (e.g., PET-CT, PET-MRI) to leverage their complementary strengths. This enhances the overall information content and diagnostic accuracy.

### 5.3 Challenges in 3D Medical Image Analysis:

*   **Large Data Sizes**:
    *   **Problem**: 3D medical images (volumes) are much larger than 2D images, often consisting of hundreds of slices.
    *   **Impact**: Requires significant memory, storage, and computational power, making processing and training computationally intensive and time-consuming.
*   **High Computational Cost**:
    *   **Problem**: Operations on 3D data (e.g., 3D convolutions in neural networks) are inherently more expensive than their 2D counterparts.
    *   **Impact**: Training complex 3D deep learning models can require powerful hardware (GPUs) and long training times.
*   **Need for Precise Ground-Truth Annotations**:
    *   **Problem**: Creating accurate 3D segmentations or labels (voxel-wise annotations) requires extensive manual effort by highly skilled medical professionals, often for each slice in a volume.
    *   **Impact**: Limited availability of high-quality, large-scale 3D annotated datasets is a major bottleneck for supervised learning.

## 6.5 Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Systems

**Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems** are software applications designed to assist clinicians (radiologists, pathologists, etc.) in interpreting medical images and making diagnostic decisions. They leverage pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to detect abnormalities, quantify disease parameters, and provide second opinions.

### 6.1 Introduction to CAD Systems:

*   **Purpose**: CAD systems provide **second opinions** and assist radiologists in detecting and diagnosing diseases. They act as "intelligent assistants" rather than replacements for human experts.
*   **Aim**: To improve the **accuracy, efficiency, and consistency** of diagnosis, especially for subtle or early-stage pathologies that might be missed by the human eye.

### 6.2 Components of CAD:

CAD systems typically follow a pipeline similar to general image processing, but tailored for medical data:

1.  **Preprocessing**:
    *   **Purpose**: Enhances the raw medical image quality for better analysis.
    *   **Techniques**: Includes **noise reduction** (e.g., Gaussian, Median, Wavelet filters) and **artifact correction** (e.g., metal artifact reduction in CT, bias field correction in MRI).

2.  **Segmentation**:
    *   **Purpose**: Accurately delineates relevant anatomical or pathological regions (e.g., organs, tumors, lesions).
    *   **Importance**: Provides the "region of interest" for further analysis and quantification.

3.  **Feature Extraction**:
    *   **Purpose**: Extracts quantitative descriptors from the segmented regions that characterize the underlying patterns.

        *   **Intensity features**: Statistical measures of pixel/voxel values (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, histogram properties).
        *   **Deep features**: Features automatically learned by deep neural networks (e.g., from convolutional layers), which are often more abstract and discriminative than hand-crafted features.

4.  **Classification**:
    *   **Purpose**: Uses extracted features to classify the region or image into predefined categories (e.g., healthy vs. diseased, benign vs. malignant, specific disease type).
    *   **Methods**:
        *   **Classical Machine Learning (ML)**: Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are trained on extracted features.
        *   **Deep Learning**: CNN-based architectures are increasingly used for end-to-end diagnosis, directly learning to classify images or regions without explicit feature engineering.

### 6.3 Applications of CAD:

CAD systems are widely applied across various medical domains:

*   **Mammography for breast cancer detection**:
    *   Detects microcalcifications, masses, and architectural distortions that could indicate early-stage breast cancer.

    *   Aids in the detection and characterization of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis lesions, and brain tumors from MRI or PET scans.
*   **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection**: Automatically analyzes retinal images to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy.

### 6.4 Challenges and Trends in Medical Imaging & CAD:

*   **Generalization**:
    *   **Challenge**: Ensuring that AI models perform consistently and accurately across diverse datasets, patient populations, different scanner types, and varying image acquisition protocols.
*   **Interpretability**:
    *   **Challenge**: Making AI models "explainable" to clinicians. Clinicians need to understand *why* a model made a particular prediction or segmentation, especially in high-stakes diagnostic decisions.
*   **Integration**:
    *   **Challenge**: Seamlessly incorporating CAD systems into existing clinical workflows and IT infrastructure (e.g., PACS - Picture Archiving and Communication Systems, EHR - Electronic Health Records).
*   **Privacy and Regulation**:
    *   **Challenge**: Ensuring compliance with strict healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and obtaining regulatory approval for AI-powered medical devices.

### 7. Summary and Takeaways:

Medical imaging, enriched by pattern recognition techniques, is transforming healthcare by improving the accuracy, efficiency, and scope of diagnosis and treatment planning. Advances in deep learning and 3D analysis are driving the development of powerful CAD systems that can complement and augment human expertise, moving towards precision medicine.
